### Encyption vs Hashing

`Hashing` is the process of converting the information into a key using a hash function. The original information cannot be retrieved from the hash key by any means. Generally, the hash keys are stored in the database and they are compared to check whether the original information matches or not. They are generally used to store the passwords for login. Some of the examples of a hashing algorithm are MD5, SHA256.

`Encryption` is the process of converting a normal readable message known as plaintext into a garbage message or not readable message known as Ciphertext. The ciphertext obtained from the encryption can easily be transformed into plaintext using the encryption key. Some of the examples of encryption algorithms are RSA, AES, and Blowfish.
